# Color_detection_using_OpenCV
In this Project of color detection is created using openCV python
Introduction:
In real life colour detection gets used in many fields like PHARMACEUTICAL / FOOD PROCESSING, 
Detecting register marks on a packaging sheet, in industry products have specific colour code upon that 
they got differentiated and for all of this the colour detection get used.

For that we have created ‘COLOUR DETECTION USING OPENCV’ in this we are going to use OpenCV for detection of colour in other words we are going to use Camera to detect the colour in front of the camera, we have to just take the object in front of camera then the object’s colour. We are going to use RGB values for detecting the colour and also the name will be given for that particular colour.

Here some applications of Colour detection:
•	Colour mark detection. PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD PROCESSING / PACKAGING.
•	Detecting register marks on a packaging sheet. PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD PROCESSING / PACKAGING.
•	Colour mark detection of screw head. AUTOMOBILES.
•	Distinguishing colour when there is background object.

Data used: 
OpenCV library:
For this Project we are going to use OpenCV as our main library which can be use for image editing and live video editing, OpenCV gives the image and video fame by frame and gives us functions that can be used for draw the video or process the video.

Numpy: 
Numpy for flipping the image or frame because in default the image coming from the camera is mirror image.  

Imutils:
Imutils for resizing the frame. It gives functions for resizing the frames.it is also get used for reading the video stream in our case it is web cam of our laptop.

Pandas:
We are Pandas for reading the CSV file. Because we are going to give the name of the colour the CSV file has the name of the colour according to their RGB values. 

CSV file:
Here we are going to use a CSV file named ‘Colours’ which will give us the name of the colours according to the RGB values i.e Red Green Blue values. The CSV file contains the name of the every colour and their RGB values. Link below is for downloading the CSV file. We downloaded file from a github.
